####Winter Term
Hello everyone,

Just wanted to touch base on a few things related to next term.
#####First Class
Our first class of the term is January 4, 2016; everyone is expected to attend. For that class please have the following completed:
- Please print out your reflective assessment or have it handy so we can discuss it one-on-one.
- Please have a winter timeline ready to show. The winter timeline is essentially a rough outline of what you plan to do this term. Remember, this is a *self-directed course*; especially in this term, it is you who manages your progress and expectations as to how you endeavour to perform. Keep the timeline realistic and vague if you remain unsure of certain aspects of your project.
- Please indicate to me how you plan to show your process this term. Many students found it beneficial to document their work via a website. If you decide to do so, please provide me with a link by the first week of class.

#####Meeting Schedule
All classes are open to all students and full attendance is recommended. However, due to the complex nature, variety and quantity of the student projects the first 3.5 hours of class time will be reserved for the following groups and dates (below) to review their project progress in depth. Any other issues from other groups may be discussed during the remaining 0.5 hr of class.

Group A, consisting of Ramis, Mike, Taylor, Ryan, Kevin, Michelle Lee, and Melanie should come to class January 4, January 11, January 18, January 25, February 9, February 22, March 7, March 21 and March 30

Group B, consisting of Megan, Michelle Fok, Anna, Calvin, Umaymah, Sakshi, and Joanna will meet January 4, January 11, January 18, February 1, February 9, February 29, March 14 and March 28

So, the Schedule for next term will be as follows:
01/04 - Week 1 - All
01/11 - Week 2 - All
01/18 - Week 3 - All (Presentation)
01/25 - Week 4 - Group A Critiques
02/01 - Week 5 - Group B Critiques
02/09 - Week 6 - All (Presentation)
02/15 - READING WEEK
02/22 - Group A Critiques
02/29 - Group B Critiques
03/07 - Group A Critiques
03/14 - Group B Critiques
03/21 - Group A Final Presentations (Group B: you should come and support your peers)
03/28 - Group B Final Presentations (Group A: you should come and support your peers)

I wish everyone a pleasant holiday season. Next term will surely be a busy—but ultimately rewarding—experience.

####Design Proposal Document

Hi everyone, for the design proposal and presentation in Week 10, I wanted to outline my expectations for what is submitted that day.

– You will submit to me a writing document that adheres to graphic design-related quality standards, with more of an emphasis on the content than the "design” of the piece.

– You will clearly state to me your strategy for making graphic design work based on your research discoveries from the research report.

– You will identify a design challenge that is personal to you (i.e., taking on more analog methods of making rather digital).

– You will answer the following questions related to your final artifact:
	— who is it for?
	— what am I going to do?
	— why am I going to do it?
	— how am I going to do it?

– You will include supporting documentation of project details, including content sources, analysis of related issues and technical considerations. It should demonstrate the impact of the primary research on the direction of the project. 
You should scan in all of your process work (sketches) to date and submit it with your proposal.

The Design Proposal should include the following sections:
######1. Title page
######2. Table of Contents page
######3. Project Statement 

– Demonstrate the links to your primary research. Primary research includes data gathered from questionnaires and interviews as well as anything that you have made for this project up until this point. If you have no data gathered, nor anything made, you will need rectify this in order to complete this proposal.

######4. Objectives
– Communication objectives, experiential objectives.
– What are your goals? What do you want to get out of this? What do you hope others get out of the work that you make?

######5. User Definition 
– demographics, psychographics, personas.
– Who are your users, stakeholders or sample of individuals that will benefit from your piece? Is your work therapeutic? To whom? Does the work target a particular demographic of individuals?

######6. Functionality
How does your piece “work?” What does it serve to do? Does it heal? Does it generate awareness? If it’s interactive, how do you use it? Walk me through the functionality of the piece.

######7. Description of Deliverables

Describe as precisely as you can the final piece that you envision at this point. Be as articulate as you can. THIS SECTION COUNTS. Do not overlook the importance in giving me a quality vision of your final artifact.

######8. Primary Research

What data have you gathered from your participants? What were the results? What have you learned?

If you chose to go the exploratory route, then what have you made so far? This will be considered your primary research. Get it? The actual making is considered research here (who knew!).

I cannot stress enough how important articulating this section is for this project.
The research report was all about secondary research (information gathered from other people’s research). Primary research is the direct opposite: it’s the research you did yourself. Your data. Your hands making stuff. Your research. I need to see that you are capable of producing primary research is some form or another so that you’re best able to move forward in the term to follow.

My questions when reading these documents will be the following:
— Is the proposed project suitable for 4000 level investigation?
— Is the student capable of completing this workload on both a quantitative and qualitative level?
— Does the department and/or the student have access to the necessary technical and academic resources to complete this work?
— Are the projects and related design activities defined in enough detail to adequately evaluate this proposal and reflect the student’s grasp of the depth and range of each project?

The Design Proposal Document will be worth 30% of the semester grade and assessed based on the following criteria:
— 10% Title, Contents and Project Statement
— 10% Objectives
— 25% User Definition
— 10% Functionality
— 10% Description of Deliverables
— 35% Primary Research

DESIGN PROPOSAL PRESENTATION

The key concepts of the Design Proposal will be presented in person by each student as a Live Proposal Presentation in Week 10 (November 17).

– Each presentation will be a maximum of 10 minutes
– You can use Keynote/PowerPoint
– You should structure your presentation around the document you will submit that day.
– Include visuals of your process work
– Tell us how you arrived at your topic
– Tell us your thesis statement 
– Tell us what your strategy will be going forward
– Talk to us about your design challenge
– Answer: who is the piece designed for?
– Answer:what am I going to do?
– Answer: why am I going to do it?


Please let me know if you have any questions,
