Title: Fall Project Documentation with Reflective Assessment

----

Text: The Fall Project Documentation is a bound document containing a visual record, with annotation, of your Fall activities in Design Workshop. 

From the Project Documentation an outside observer should easily recognize the investment in research being made to support the resulting project. Original content and references, such as photography, video, written text and illustrations should be completed and/or compiled into this document. Sourced content must be properly cited and annotated. Planning documentation such as branding tests, process maps, storyboards, visual treatments, organizational diagrams and art direction specifications should be included, and generated as needed on a continuing basis throughout the production of the Design Project.

The reflective assessment will take the form of a (minimum) one-page prologue to your Fall Project Documentation, and should briefly explain the inception and progress of your project as well as discuss your research methodologies and design approach. It should provide a snapshot of the project to an outside observer and provide you with an opportunity to reflect upon the self-directed, research-based nature of the design process.

####GRADING BREAKDOWN

The Fall Project Documentation is worth 15% of the Fall term.
