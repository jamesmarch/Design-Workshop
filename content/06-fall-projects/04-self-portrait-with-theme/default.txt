Title: Visual Essay & Research Report

----

Text: ######In the first phase of this project students will develop a deeper understanding of their area of interest or theme by conducting preliminary research and visual exploration in the form of a Visual Essay. After review, a principle research focus will be determined.  In the second phase—focusing on the primary research alone—the visual essay and research will be further developed and refined to help form the basis for the Design Project Proposal and the Final Artifact. The work in Research in Design and all studio courses to date should inform this project. The issue at hand is to define and produce a research question and design problem that is indicative of the Final Artifact that will be produced in the Winter term.

####Phase One — 15% (Fall)

*Exploratory Visual Essay 5%*
You will prepare a visual body of work exploring a minimum of (3) three areas of interest in relation to a theme or concept. It is important to note that at this stage the Visual Essay may be both informational (factual) and expressive (interpretative). Direct documentation and artifacts of all kinds (drawings, photos, video, process maps, etc.) form the basis for creative components with which to design and communicate research findings. 

*Preliminary Research Report 10%*
Prepare a new or revised visual essay exploring your primary research topic. At this stage the Visual Essay may be both informational (factual) and expressive (interpretative) but should develop more meaningful exploration of the primary topic and be inherently practical in nature. Direct documentation and artifacts of all kinds (drawings, photos, video, process maps, etc.) form the basis for creative components with which to design and communicate research findings.

####Phase Two — 30% Fall Grade

*Final Visual Essay 10%*
Prepare a new or revised visual essay exploring your primary research topic. At this stage the Visual Essay may be both informational (factual) and expressive (interpretative) but should develop more meaningful exploration of the primary topic and be inherently practical in nature. Direct documentation and artifacts of all kinds (drawings, photos, video, process maps, etc.) form the basis for creative components with which to design and communicate research findings.

*Final Research Report 20%*
The Final Research Report will document the primary and secondary research conducted on the primary research topic and should follow the format provided. This final report provides the context and background for your Design Project Proposal.
