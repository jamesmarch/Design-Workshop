Title: Content Development

----

Text: Each student is responsible for developing a unique interpretation of the theme and related research. Design projects should be supported in concept and guided by research findings. An outside observer should easily recognize a connection between the theme and the resulting project. Original content and references, such as photography, video, written text, illustrations should be completed and/or compiled before the Winter term. Sourced content must be properly cited and annotated in the Reference section of the Design Proposal. Planning documentation such as process maps, storyboards, visual treatments, organizational diagrams and art direction specifications should be included in the Project Prep document, and generated as needed on a continuing basis throughout the Design Project’s production.
