Title: Project Management (Reflective Assessment)

----

Text: The reflective assessment will take the form of a (minimum) one-page prologue to your Fall Project Documentation, and should briefly explain the inception and progress of your project as well as discuss your research methodologies and design approach. It should provide a snapshot of the project to an outside observer and provide you with an opportunity to reflect upon the self-directed, research-based nature of the design process.

####GRADING BREAKDOWN

Project Management is worth 10% of the Fall term.
