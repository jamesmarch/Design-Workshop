Title: Research Report

----

Text: The Research Report will document the primary and secondary research conducted. The Literature Review section of the report will include annotated bibliographies of
secondary source material and a section synthesizing and summarizing the findings in
the existing literature. The Literature Review provides context and background for the primary research and establishes what research already exists. Research will be conducted independently, however students with similar topics are encouraged to share their findings.

Ideally, the resulting analysis should cover a minimum of 12 books/articles/reports and 24 websites or an equivalent as determined by the Course Director.

The Research Report will be assessed based on the following criteria:
— 20% Report structure
— 50% Content
— 20% Writing clarity and style
— 10% Presentation
