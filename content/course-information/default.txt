Title: Course Description

----

Text: Students develop a self-directed project involving extensive research and use a multi-disciplined approach in solving two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and interactive digital design problems. The project proposal is adjudicated by the Course Directors.

#### Expanded Course Description
Design Workshop presents students with the opportunity to conceive, develop and finalize their own work independently, under the supervision of a course director and with peer involvement. Students must take into account the practical, economic, cultural and aesthetic challenges of their project as if for a real-world audience.

Design Workshop is unique in the program. It first requires you to research and investigate a given theme, developing an understanding of the many aspects of the theme. The ultimate design objects are not predetermined. Only after thorough research and consideration of intended audiences will you begin to define what forms your designs will take. Working with your Course Director, you will finalize the definition of designed objects, making sure they constitute acceptable results for the three-credit Winter term.

You will be encouraged to research the thematic material both through conventional library and other sources, as well as to investigate it visually by documenting aspects of it in our environment. You will have to leave your computer and venture out to other sources of information, as well as to witness and visually record manifestations of the theme in the world around you.

During the Fall term all students will engage in primary and secondary research to explore the theme. They will report on the results of their research and develop a proposal for a design project that integrates their research as project content. During the Winter term students will complete their design project deliverables.

Class time is allocated for ongoing work on projects as well as personal and group critiques. There will be special lectures on topics related to selected themes. Workshop time will thus consist of:
— ongoing work on projects
— presentation, by students, of work in progress
— discussion of work challenges and related questions with faculty and peers
— special lectures

Attendance in class is mandatory and punctuality is expected as important class content will be introduced at the beginning of class.

#### Materials
Specific requirements and some specific materials may be required for completion of projects. Their cost will vary depending on the materials and techniques chosen by each student.

#### Special Conditions
Please note that the format for Design Workshop does not allow for teaching of new technology. Students must be able to complete projects at the level they have already achieved with print or interactive media.

#### Eligibility for Professional Digital Certificate
Workshop will count for three credits towards the Professional Digital Certificate only if students pursue a multimedia project. Multimedia projects that are more involved can be worth six credits only upon approval of the course director. 

#### Course Learning Objectives
*Professional*
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
— conduct individual academic and visual research and prepare a research report
— conceive an appropriate overall project and break it down into its component parts
— negotiate a project proposal based on a research report
— present ideas, challenges and questions to an audience of peers and instructors
— critique the work of other students in an observant, constructive manner
— set appropriate, realistic deadlines and meet them
— manage all aspects of a project responsibly
— work with others in a cooperative and collegial way

*Technical and Theoretical*
Upon successful completion of this course, students will demonstrate:
— extended and refined knowledge of design theory and information technologies
— an increased awareness of strategic goals, client relationship and identifying issues surrounding the design process
— develop a design intelligence and sensitivity that extends beyond the visual aesthetic

#### The Theme
The theme will be large, general and of worldwide interest with many facets, involving many disciplines such as science, ethics and cultural studies, and a theme about which many views are held. This approach is similar to some major international design competitions which state a general theme, and expect the design community to provide new insights into it and its ramifications. Through both your academic research, your experience of the theme and your visual research, you will establish an area within the theme to pursue further, ultimately determining the design deliverables that you complete for the course.

#### Evaluation and Grading
*Definitions of evaluation criteria*
Concept: Originality, appropriateness and the ability to articulate the merits and processes involved in the solution. Does the final solution have impact? Is it innovative, relevant and informative?

Process: The ability to analyze ideas within the framework of project requirements,
to conduct research, to explore a wide range of initial approaches, and to test and
refine solutions.

Presentation (Live): The ability to make concepts and information clear through verbal explanations. The ability to use visual materials to support the communication of ideas. Use of adequate volume, connecting to the audience, and making information interesting for the intended audience.

Presentation (Material): The organization and physical assembly of project materials. Precise cutting, mounting, folding. Thoughtfulness and care taken in these processes.
Project Management: The ability to meet deadlines on a consistent basis, to break down a project into phases and manage the work with minimal supervision. (A critical skill for transition to professional practice.) Students are expected to proactively move the project forward through critical phases while maintaining a strong link to the research and the given theme.

Participation: Participation in all class activities and lectures is important to the learning process. Students are expected to attend all classes, be punctual and participate in critiques and class discussions.

#### Final Course Grade
Grades from the Fall and Winter semesters are averaged together to determine the final course grade. Course grades and continuing in the course will be significantly affected by:
— frequent lateness and absence
— coming to class unprepared to participate in studio work, critique and presentation
— absence at appropriate lectures

#### Procedures for Submitting Work
All work is to be turned in personally to the course instructor during the officially scheduled class time. Assignments are to be handed in at the beginning of class on the due date unless otherwise specified. At York, under normal situations, the Design Office will not accept drop-off of student work. In the rare case of illness of the instructor on a due date, special arrangements can be made (between the Course Director and the Office) with the Office for the submission of student work.

In case of unusual circumstances, students at Sheridan may submit their work by depositing it into the drop-off mail slot, provided by the mail room at Sheridan. Please address your envelope(s) to your instructor and inform the instructor immediately about this special arrangement.

Assignments received later than the due date will be penalized 10% per business day that the assignment is late.

Exceptions to the late project penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the course instructor but will require documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter). Further extensions or accommodation will require students to submit a formal petition to the Faculty.

#### Attendance and lateness
Regular and punctual attendance is required professional behaviour in industry and therefore in this program. Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. Students are responsible for letting faculty know ahead of time if they are going to be late for class, or not attending. Being late twice equals one absence. Lateness of more than thirty minutes equals one absence. If a student is absent from four classes during the term, a grade of “F” will be given for the course. Exceptions to the attendance and lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., may be entertained by the Course Instructor but will require supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor’s letter). Students will be responsible for all academic, financial penalties and consequences resulting from their non-attendance.
