Title: Project 1 — Project Preparation

----

Text: *Content Presentation due Class 12 (10% of Fall term grade)*

Students are encouraged to begin design experiments and production prototyping as early as possible in the Fall term.

Project Prep will be assessed based on the following criteria:
— 80% Content Development
— 20% Winter Timeline

#### Content Development
Each student is responsible for developing a unique interpretation of the theme and related research. Design projects should be supported in concept and guided by research findings. An outside observer should easily recognize a connection between the theme and the resulting project. Original content and references, such as photography, video, written text, illustrations should be completed and/or compiled before the Winter term. Sourced content must be properly cited and annotated in the Reference section of the Design Proposal. Planning documentation such as process maps, storyboards, visual treatments, organizational diagrams and art direction specifications should be included in the Project Preparation document, and generated as needed on a continuing basis throughout the Design Project’s production
