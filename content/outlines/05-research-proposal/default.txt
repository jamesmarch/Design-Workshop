Title: Research Proposal

----

Text: *Due Class 6 (20% of Fall term grade)*

The Research Proposal will document the primary and secondary research conducted. The Scholarly (Literature) Review portion will include annotated bibliographies of secondary source material and a section synthesizing and summarizing the findings in the existing literature and sources. The Scholarly (Literature) Review provides context and background for the primary research and establishes what research already exists.

Research will be done independently, however students with similar topics are encouraged to share their findings. The resulting analysis of sources in the annotated bibliography should cover a minimum of 12 books/articles/reports and 24 websites. The report will follow the format set out by the Course Director reviewed in class and will be graded on the following elements:
— 20% Report structure
— 50% Content
— 20% Writing clarity and style
— 10% Presentation

All references, sources, quotations, visual material and other supporting information must be properly cited. Original research artifacts must be documented with a discussion of method and results.
