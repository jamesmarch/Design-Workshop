Title: Visual Essay

----

Text: *Due Week 4 (20% of Fall term grade)*

The Visual Essay is a visual presentation of research discoveries and the result of exploring and possibly your own personal relationship to the ideas inherent in your topic. It will be delivered as a large-format printed poster or as a video, interactive or motion project. Projects will be displayed publicly in the York/Sheridan hallway showcases and/or on the internet.

It is important to note that the essay may be both informational (factual) and expressive (interpretative). Direct documentation and artifacts of all kinds (drawings, photos, video, process maps, etc.) form the basis for creative components with which to design the “essay” and communicate research findings. A process document will accompany the submitted project in print/media (e.g. process document may take the form of a blog).

Visual Essay will be graded based on the following criteria:
— 20% Breadth and depth of investigation
— 40% Effectiveness of communication
— 30% Visual Quality
— 10% Presentation
